    "\n",
    "|Operator |Meaning |\n",
    "|---------|--------|\n",
    "|>        |Greater than - This is `True` is the left operand is greater than the right|\n",
    "|<        |Less than - This is `True` is the left operand is less than the right one|\n",
    "|==       |Equal to - This is `True` only when both operands are equal|\n",
    "|!=       |Not equal to - This is `True` if the operands are not equal|\n",
    "|>=       |Greater than or equal to - This is `True` when the left operand is greater than or equal to the right|\n",
    "|<=       |Less than or equal to - This is `True` when the left operand is less than or equal to the right|\n",
