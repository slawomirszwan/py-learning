    "# Chapter 13 - Python Comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports a short hand method for creating lists, dictionaries and sets that is known as **comprehensions**. The common use case is that you want to create a new list where each element has had some kind of operation done to them. For example, if you have a `list` of numbers and you want to create a new `list` with all the numbers doubled, you could use a comprehension.\n",

    "A `list` comprehension allows you to create a list from another sequence, such as a `list` or `dict`. You end up using list-like syntax with a `for` loop on a single line.\n",

    "The syntax goes of a list comprehension is having square brackets that contain an expression followed by a `for` loop. This can optionally be followed by zero or more `for` or `if` clauses.\n",
